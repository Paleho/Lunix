# Lunix Driver for OSlab course @NTUA, 2020 - 2021

The goal was to develop a character device driver for linux in order receive raw data from a system of sensors (light, battery, temperature) and serve them in user space.  We used locks and spinlocks to make the driver usable for multiple users at the same time. Our course instructor V. Koukis provided the skeleton for each source file.
